# dxf 
2d format for most laser cutters and plate cutting services 
- f12/f13: f row config
- ansi/iso: layout for american standard vs. rest of the world
- full/half: switch cutouts for every key vs. alphas missing. half plates are done 60 style with numrow still in place
- tsangan (optional): extremely restrictive layout in the config that the keyboard should be built
